## Handling Sensitive Data

When working with sensitive information like passwords, you can use the `sensitiveData` parameter to prevent the model from seeing the actual values while still allowing it to reference them in its actions.

Here's an example of how to use sensitive data:

```js
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { Agent } from "browsernode";

// Initialize the model
const llm = new ChatOpenAI({
	model: "gpt-4o",
	temperature: 0.0,
});

// Define sensitive data
// The model will only see the keys (x_name, x_password) but never the actual values
const sensitiveData = { x_name: "fake_name", x_password: "12345678" };

// bad case task prompt,too simple
// const bad_case_task_prompt ="go to x.com and login with x_name and x_password then write a post about the meaning of life";

// Use a more detailed task description for X.com's multi-step login
const task = `Go to x.com and complete the login process:
1. Click on "Sign in" if needed
2. Look for the username/email/phone input field and enter x_name
3. Click the "Next" button to proceed
4. Wait for the password field to appear, then enter x_password
5. Click the final "Log in" button
6. Once logged in, write a post about the meaning of life`;

// Pass the sensitive data to the agent
const agent = new Agent(task, llm, {
	sensitiveData: sensitiveData,
	maxActionsPerStep: 1, // Execute one action at a time for better control
});

await agent.run();

```

In this example:
1. The model only sees `x_name` and `x_password` as placeholders.
2. When the model wants to use your password it outputs x_password - and we replace it with the actual value.
3. When your password is visable on the current page, we replace it in the LLM input - so that the model never has it in its state.

Warning: Vision models still see the image of the page - where the sensitive data might be visible.

This approach ensures that sensitive information remains secure while still allowing the agent to perform tasks that require authentication.

Tips:
1. Use a more detailed task description for multi-step login.
2. Execute one action at a time for better control.
