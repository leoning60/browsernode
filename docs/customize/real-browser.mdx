## Overview

You can connect the agent to your real Chrome browser instance, allowing it to access your existing browser profile with all your logged-in accounts and settings. This is particularly useful when you want the agent to interact with services where you're already authenticated.

<Note>
  First make sure to close all running Chrome instances.

## Basic Configuration

To connect to your real Chrome browser, you'll need to specify the path to your Chrome executable when creating the Browser instance:

```js
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { Agent, Browser, BrowserConfig } from "browsernode";

const llm = new ChatOpenAI({
	modelName: "gpt-4o",
	temperature: 0.0,
	streaming: true,
	openAIApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

const task = "Search for the latest nvidia stock price";
// const task =" Write a letter in Google Docs to my Papa, thanking him for everything, and save the document as a PDF.";

// Create browser configuration
const config = new BrowserConfig({
	headless: false, // Make sure the browser is visible
	browserClass: "chromium", // Use Chrome/Chromium
	browserInstancePath: "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome", // Path to Chrome on macOS
	extraBrowserArgs: [
		"--start-maximized",
		"--user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-browsernode", // Use a separate user data directory
		"--download-path=/tmp/chrome-browsernode/Downloads",
	], // Optional: start with maximized window
	forceKeepBrowserAlive: true, // Add this option to prevent closing browser when using existing instance
});

const agent = new Agent(task, llm, {
	browser: new Browser(config),
});
// Run the agent task and handle process termination
await agent.run();
```


<Note>
  When using your real browser, the agent will have access to all your logged-in sessions. Make sure to ALWAYS review the task you're giving to the agent and ensure it aligns with your security requirements!
