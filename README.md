<h3 align="center">Browsernode is TypeScript implementation of <a href="https://browser-use.com/">Browser-use</a> </h3>

üåê Browsernode is the easiest way to connect your AI agents with the browser.
‚úÖ Browsernode is compatible with all of <a href="https://browser-use.com/"> Browser-use</a> APIs and features.


# Quick start

with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v10.9.0 or higher)

```bash
npm install browsernode
```
Install Playwright:
[Installation | Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro)
```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

```bash
playwright install chromium
```

Spin up your agent:

```javascript
import { Agent } from "browsernode";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "browsernode/llm";

const llm = new ChatOpenAI({
	model: "gpt-4.1",
	temperature: 0.0,
	apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

const task = "Search for the latest tesla stock price";
const agent = new Agent({
	task: task,
	llm: llm,
});
agent.run();
```

Add your API keys for the provider you want to use to your `.env` file.
```bash
mv .env.example .env
```

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```
For other settings, models, and more, check out the [documentation üìï](https://docs.browsernode.com).
